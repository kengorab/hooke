## Goals
Achieve parity with as many of the features of Spring's Dependency Injection as I can, making use of annotations such as  `@Component`, `@Autowired`, `@Bean`, `@Qualifier`, `@PostConstruct`, and others.

This is _absolutely, 100% not_ meant to be a drop-in replacement for Spring. If you replace Spring with this project then you should probably be fired.
